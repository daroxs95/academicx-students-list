AcademicX - Frontend Developer Role - Interview Task

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

## Notes

- Vanilla css along with css modules is used for styling due simplicity and fast development.
- Data fetching is implemented server side to protect the open API endpoint and avoid it's exposure.

## TODO

- Fix deploy to cloudflare edge runtime runtime errors (Related to react server components)
- Fix carousel layout shift on page load (Related swiper and presumably app hydration)
